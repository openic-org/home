# Welcome to OpenIC

We are a new organization focusing on Research & Development (R&D) of Integrated Circuits (ICs) and surrounding electronics using Open-Source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. We aim to work closely with Universities, Research Institutions, and Industry, especially with small organizations, startups, and academic labs, to provide them with custom ICs at a low cost.

We are interested in all IC R&D areas and will initially focus on Biomedical Applications. Our goal is to develop a framework where you can use open-source/proprietary Process Design Kits (PDKs) and open-source analog/digital blocks with open-source EDA tools to develop your ICs.

More details coming soon!
