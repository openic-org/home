# Welcome to OpenIC

We are a new organization focusing on Research & Develoment (R&D) of Integrated Circuits (ICs) using Open-Source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. We aim to work closely with Universities, Research Institutions, and Industry, specially with small organizations, startups, and academic labs, to provide them with custom ICs at a low cost.

We are interested in all IC R&D areas and will initially focus on Biomedical Applications. Our goal is to develop a framework where you can use open-source/propietary Process Design Kits (PDKs) and open-source analog/digital blocks with open-source EDA tools to develop your ICs.
