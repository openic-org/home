## For Countries in the HCCH

1.  Apostille your diploma in the state it was issued.&#x20;

    1. Through your University's Registrar's Office
       1. Link: [https://registrar.caltech.edu/records/apostille ](https://registrar.caltech.edu/records/apostille)
       2. Mention what country you will use the documents in.
    2. California: Secretary of State; any Assistant Secretary of State; any Deputy Secratary of State
       1. Link: [https://www.sos.ca.gov/notary/authentication/](https://www.sos.ca.gov/notary/authentication/)
       2. e-Register: [https://apostille-search.sos.ca.gov/ ](https://apostille-search.sos.ca.gov/)

    > Note:
    >
    > In my case, I did the apostille directly with Caltech, and they did the certification with a Public Notary and sent the diplomas/transcripts to the Secretary of State of California. I received the apostilled documents a few weeks later.


2.  Translate your diplomas.

    1. One option is: Enlace Traducciones ([https://enlacetraducciones.com/en/home/](https://enlacetraducciones.com/en/home/))

    > Note:
    >
    > I did the translation at _Enlace Traducciones_. Everything was done through _WhatsApp_, including sending the scanned documents and receiving the certified translated copies. Payment was easily done via online deposit. Total cost was S/ 160 per apostilled diploma.
    >
    > The apostilled diploma consists of 2 pages: the apostille page and the diploma.

1. Send DNI number
2. Send money
3. Ask to make payment on your request
4. Ask to sent you back the receipt
